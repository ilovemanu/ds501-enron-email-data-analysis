# ds501-eron-email-data-analysis

In this project, we were provided with the Enron dataset. 
- We mainly focused on emails that were sent during the month of October, 2001, when the Enron scandal was publicized. 
- We analyzed the number of emails sent as well as the sentiment in those emails to see how Enron employees were reacting to the scandal.
- We also took an unsupervised approach to classify the October emails based on their message contents, which also could give us insights into employees' hehavior.

The complete story is described in the pdf file. Code implementation can be found in case4_final.ipynb. Data source can be found within the notebook.
